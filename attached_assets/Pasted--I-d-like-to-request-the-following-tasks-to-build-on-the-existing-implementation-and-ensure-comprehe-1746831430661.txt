 I’d like to request the following tasks to build on the existing implementation and ensure comprehensive communication capabilities:

a. Finalize "Add Client" and Notification Integration
Ensure the "Add Client" form is fully connected to the backend, automatically triggering a welcome email (via SendGrid) and an optional welcome SMS (via Twilio) upon client creation.
Add a checkbox or toggle in the "Add Client" form for admins to choose whether to send a welcome SMS alongside the email, with preloaded default messages that can be customized later.
b. Implement Communication Template System
As discussed previously, create a "Communication Templates" section in the admin dashboard for managing SMS, email, and in-app notification templates.
Preload default SMS and email templates for key scenarios, including:
Appointment Request: “Hi {ClientName}, we’ve received your appointment request for {AppointmentDate}. Reply to confirm or reschedule.”
Onboarding Request: “Welcome, {ClientName}! Your onboarding with ManageTheFans is in progress. Reply with any questions.”
Reminder: “Reminder, {ClientName}: Your appointment is on {AppointmentDate} at {AppointmentTime}. Reply to confirm.”
Payment Request: “Hi {ClientName}, your payment of {PaymentAmount} is due by {PaymentDueDate}. Reply for payment options.”
Payment Confirmation: “Thank you, {ClientName}! We’ve received your payment of {PaymentAmount}. Reply for a receipt.”
General Update: “Hi {ClientName}, here’s an update from ManageTheFans: {Message}. Reply for assistance.”
Allow admins to edit these templates and add new ones with placeholder variables for personalization (e.g., {ClientName}, {AppointmentDate}).
c. Automation and Manual Sending Options
Enable automated triggers for notifications based on specific events (e.g., send a reminder SMS 24 hours before an appointment, send a payment request email/SMS when due).
Provide a manual sending option in the ClientsManagement page, allowing admins to select a template and send an SMS or email to individual clients or bulk to filtered groups (e.g., all clients with upcoming appointments).
d. Communication History and Reporting
Add a "Communication History" tab in the admin dashboard to log all sent emails, SMS, and notifications, displaying details such as template used, recipient, timestamp, and delivery status (success/failed).
Include a simple reporting feature to summarize communication activity (e.g., total messages sent per week/month, success rate).
e. Testing and Production Readiness
Add a “Send Test” feature for templates, allowing admins to test messages to themselves or a dummy account to verify formatting and personalization.
Conduct a final review to confirm all components (database, functions, webhooks, APIs) are functioning as expected and the application is production-ready. Please provide a detailed report summarizing the implementation, any issues encountered, and confirmation of readiness for deployment.
