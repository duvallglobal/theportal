I'm still facing an issue where the screen is not loading properly in Replit. Additionally, I have specific requirements for routing, test credentials, and database setup. Let's address these systematically, starting with the urgent loading issue.

Screen Not Loading Issue: The app or specific pages (like the login page) are not rendering correctly in Replit. Please help me diagnose why the screen isn't loading. Check for any console errors, routing issues, or missing configurations in Replit that might be preventing the UI from displaying. Provide step-by-step instructions to resolve this, including any necessary file edits or restarts.
Admin and Client Routing: Ensure that the routing for both admin and client portals is properly set up in App.tsx. I need distinct routes for admin and client dashboards with protected access. If these routes are not yet implemented or are causing issues, please provide or update the necessary code to establish /admin/dashboard for admin users and /client/dashboard for client users, with appropriate authentication checks.
Test Login Credentials: For testing purposes, I need predefined login credentials for both an admin and a client account. Please provide or create test user data (e.g., email/password pairs) for both roles. If these need to be manually added to the database, include instructions on how to do so in Replit.
Database Table Setup: Iâ€™ve noticed that the database tables are not yet set up. Please guide me through creating the necessary tables for user authentication, session storage, and role management (admin vs. client) in PostgreSQL. Provide SQL scripts or step-by-step instructions to set up these tables using the DATABASE_URL secret in Replit. Ensure the schema supports differentiating between admin and client users.
Verify Authentication Flow: Once the screen loading issue is resolved and the database is set up, let's ensure the login page renders correctly and redirects to the appropriate dashboard (admin or client) based on user role upon successful login. If there are any issues with navigation or UI elements, please provide fixes or adjustments.
Design Feedback: Regarding the design of the authentication pages, I'd like a clean, professional, and modern look that aligns with a premium service for adult content management. If the current design doesn't meet this expectation, suggest or implement UI improvements using Tailwind CSS for styling.
Next Steps: After resolving the loading issue, setting up routing, database, and test credentials, I'd like to focus on integrating Stripe for payment processing. Please prepare guidance for setting up subscription or payment features in the portal.
Please prioritize fixing the screen loading issue first. Provide detailed steps or code changes to ensure the app renders correctly in Replit. If you need screenshots or specific error messages from the console, let me know how to retrieve them, and I'll share the details. Additionally, address the routing, test credentials, and database setup as soon as possible to enable full testing of the authentication flow.
