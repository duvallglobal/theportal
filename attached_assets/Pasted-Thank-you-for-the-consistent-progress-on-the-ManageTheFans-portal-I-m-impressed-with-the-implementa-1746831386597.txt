Thank you for the consistent progress on the ManageTheFans portal. I’m impressed with the implementation of the "Add Client" functionality, SendGrid email integration, Twilio SMS integration, and updates to the admin dashboard. I now want to enhance our communication capabilities to ensure seamless, branded, and scenario-specific interactions with clients.

I’m requesting the development of a comprehensive template management system for SMS, email, and notifications within the admin dashboard. A key focus is enabling SMS communications for appointment requests, onboarding requests, reminders, payments (both requests and confirmations), and general updates. Below are the detailed requirements to guide this implementation.

1. Template Management Interface
Creation and Storage:
Create a dedicated section in the admin dashboard named "Communication Templates" where admins can create, edit, save, and delete templates for SMS, email, and notifications.
Categorize templates by type (Email, SMS, Notification) and purpose (e.g., Appointment Request, Payment Reminder, General).
Template Fields:
Include fields for template name (internal reference), subject line (for emails), content/body, and category.
Support placeholder variables for dynamic personalization (e.g., {ClientName}, {AppointmentDate}, {PaymentAmount}, {Link}).
Preview Functionality:
Provide a preview feature to display how templates will appear with sample data before saving or sending.
2. Email Templates (via SendGrid)
Format and Design:
Allow creation of email templates using a WYSIWYG editor (if possible) or raw HTML input, with a plain text fallback option for compatibility.
Ensure templates are responsive across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Default Templates:
Preload default email templates for common scenarios like Welcome, Appointment Confirmation, and Payment Receipt, incorporating ManageTheFans branding (logo, colors, signature).
Integration:
Connect templates to SendGrid API calls to automatically populate and send emails with dynamic data when triggered.
3. SMS Templates (via Twilio) – Key Focus
Text-Based Templates:
Provide a text input area for SMS templates, respecting character limits (e.g., 160 characters for standard SMS or longer if Twilio supports concatenation).
Support placeholder variables for personalization (e.g., {ClientName}, {AppointmentTime}, {PaymentDueDate}).
Default SMS Templates for Specific Scenarios:
Preload the following default SMS templates with concise branding and clear calls-to-action:
Appointment Request: “Hi {ClientName}, we’ve received your appointment request for {AppointmentDate}. Reply to confirm or reschedule.”
Onboarding Request: “Welcome, {ClientName}! Your onboarding with ManageTheFans is in progress. Reply with any questions.”
Reminder: “Reminder, {ClientName}: Your appointment is on {AppointmentDate} at {AppointmentTime}. Reply to confirm.”
Payment Request: “Hi {ClientName}, your payment of {PaymentAmount} is due by {PaymentDueDate}. Reply for payment options.”
Payment Confirmation: “Thank you, {ClientName}! We’ve received your payment of {PaymentAmount}. Reply for a receipt.”
General Update: “Hi {ClientName}, here’s an update from ManageTheFans: {Message}. Reply for assistance.”
Integration:
Link SMS templates to Twilio API calls, ensuring the appropriate template is used for automated or manual triggers.
4. Notification Templates (In-App or Push, if Applicable)
Format and Content:
Support templates for in-app notifications or push notifications with fields for title, message, and action link/button (if applicable).
Include placeholder variables for personalization.
Default Templates:
Preload templates for events like “Appointment Confirmed,” “Payment Received,” or “New Message.”
Integration:
Enable notifications to be triggered by user actions or admin settings using the selected template.
5. Template Usage and Automation
Manual Sending:
Allow admins to select and send templates manually to individual clients or groups (e.g., bulk SMS to clients with upcoming appointments) directly from the "Communication Templates" section or a client’s profile.
Automated Triggers:
Implement automation by linking templates to events, such as:
“Onboarding Request” SMS/email upon onboarding status update.
“Reminder” SMS 24 or 48 hours before an appointment (configurable).
“Payment Request” SMS/email when a payment is due.
“Payment Confirmation” SMS/email upon payment receipt.
Provide a settings page where admins can assign default templates to triggers and customize timing.
Logging and Reporting:
Maintain a communication history tab in the admin dashboard, logging all sent messages (SMS, email, notifications) with details like template used, recipient, timestamp, and delivery status (success/failed).
6. Testing and Validation
Test Feature:
Add a “Send Test” option for each template type, allowing admins to send test messages to themselves or a dummy account to verify formatting and personalization.
Error Handling:
Implement robust error handling for failed sends (e.g., invalid data, API issues with SendGrid/Twilio), providing clear feedback to admins.
7. Usability and Scalability
User-Friendly Design:
Ensure the "Communication Templates" interface is intuitive, with easy navigation between template types and categories.
Add tooltips or help text to guide admins on using placeholders and setting up automation.
Scalability:
Design the system to handle a growing number of templates and high volumes of communications without performance degradation.
Next Steps
Please prioritize the implementation of the template management system, focusing first on the "Communication Templates" interface and the SMS templates for appointment requests, onboarding requests, reminders, payments, and general updates using Twilio. Also, integrate email templates with SendGrid for parallel functionality. Provide an update with screenshots or a brief report once the core functionality is in place, highlighting any challenges or recommendations.

Additionally, I’m open to suggestions on tools or libraries (e.g., for email template editing) that could enhance this feature. If there are other communication scenarios or template categories you think would be valuable for ManageTheFans, please include those ideas in your update.

Thank you for your dedication to this project. I’m excited to see these communication enhancements come to fruition and support our client engagement efforts.
