1. Authentication/Authorization Problems
Multiple 401 Unauthorized errors are appearing across different sections of the application:

When creating a new client: Error creating client 401: {"message":"Unauthorized"}
When loading dashboard data: Error Loading Data 401: {"message":"Unauthorized"}
2. Data Loading Failures
Several areas of the application cannot load necessary data:

Content Viewer: "Error loading content" with a suggestion to refresh the page
User Management: "Error loading users. Please try again"
Client selection dropdown appears empty when trying to create appointments
3. Redundant User/Client Management Systems
Key Issue: The current separation between "Clients Management" and "User Management" creates unnecessary complexity and confusion:

Current Structure Problems:

Duplicate user interfaces for managing essentially the same entities
Separate data sources for what should be a unified user database
Inconsistent user experiences when managing different user types
Higher maintenance burden with two systems to update
Recommendation:

Consolidate these into a single "User Management" system
Implement role-based filtering (Admin, Client, etc.) within this unified system
Create a consistent interface for adding and managing all user types
Simplify the permission model with a unified approach to user management
4. Root Cause Analysis
These issues appear to stem from either:

Expired authentication token/session
Backend API permission issues
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration problems
API endpoint changes that haven't been reflected in the frontend
Possible server-side issues on Replit's hosting environment
Recommendation for Replit
Please investigate:

Backend authentication middleware - verify token validation is working correctly
API permissions for the current user role
Server logs for any specific error details not displayed in the UI
Recent deployment changes that may have affected API routes or authentication
Session management and token refreshing mechanisms
Consolidate the user and client management systems into a single, cohesive interface with role-based filtering
The consistent 401 errors across different features suggest this is a system-wide authentication issue rather than feature-specific bugs.
